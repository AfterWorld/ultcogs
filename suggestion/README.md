## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Channel Settings
- **Suggestion Channel**: Where suggestions are posted for voting
- **Staff Channel**: Where approved suggestions go for staff review
- **Log Channel**: Where all system actions are logged

### Voting & Approval
- **Upvote Threshold**: Number of upvotes needed to send to staff (1-50)
- **Require Reason**: Whether staff must provide reasons for approval/denial

### Content Limits
- **Min Length**: Minimum characters required (5-4000)
- **Max Length**: Maximum characters allowed (5-4000)
- **Cooldown**: Time between suggestions per user (0-86400 seconds)

### Optional Features
- **Cleanup**: Auto-delete non-suggestion messages in suggestion channel
- **DM Notifications**: Send users DMs when suggestions are processed
- **Anonymous Suggestions**: Allow users to submit suggestions anonymously

### View All Settings
```bash
[p]suggestionset settings
```

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. **Suggestion Submission**
Users submit suggestions using `[p]suggest <content>`. The bot validates the content and creates an embed with voting buttons.

### 2. **Community Voting**
Users vote using **Upvote** and **Downvote** buttons. Vote counts are tracked and displayed in real-time.

### 3. **Staff Review**
When a suggestion reaches the upvote threshold, it's automatically forwarded to the staff channel with approve/deny buttons.

### 4. **Processing**
Staff can approve or deny suggestions using buttons (with optional reasons) or commands. The original suggestion is updated with the decision.

### 5. **Notifications**
Users are notified via DM when their suggestions are processed (if enabled).

## üîß Advanced Configuration Examples

### High-Traffic Server Setup
```bash
[p]suggestionset threshold 20        # Higher threshold
[p]suggestionset cooldown 900        # 15-minute cooldown
[p]suggestionset minlength 50        # Longer minimum length
[p]suggestionset cleanup true        # Keep channel clean
```

### Casual Community Setup
```bash
[p]suggestionset threshold 3         # Lower threshold
[p]suggestionset cooldown 300        # 5-minute cooldown
[p]suggestionset minlength 10        # Shorter minimum
[p]suggestionset requirereason false # Optional reasons
```

### Anonymous Suggestion Setup
```bash
[p]suggestionset anonymous true      # Allow anonymous suggestions
[p]suggestionset dmnotifications false # Disable DMs for anonymous
```

## üìä Analytics Dashboard

The `[p]suggestioninfo` command provides comprehensive analytics:

- **Statistics**: Total suggestions, approval rates, vote counts
- **System Health**: Channel setup status, feature status
- **Top Contributors**: Most active suggestion submitters  
- **Recent Activity**: New suggestions in the last 7 days
- **Moderation Stats**: Blacklisted user count

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Buttons not working after bot restart**
- This is normal - the bot uses persistent views that automatically reconnect

**Users can't vote**
- Check bot permissions in suggestion channel
- Ensure users have "Use External Emojis" permission

**Staff buttons not responding**
- Verify staff have "Manage Guild" or "Administrator" permissions
- Check bot permissions in staff channel

**Suggestions not forwarding to staff**
- Verify staff channel is set: `[p]suggestionset staffchannel #channel`
- Check upvote threshold: `[p]suggestionset settings`

### Required Permissions

**Suggestion Channel:**
- Send Messages
- Embed Links  
- Read Message History
- Use External Emojis

**Staff Channel:**
- Send Messages
- Embed Links

**Log Channel:**
- Send Messages
- Embed Links

## üîÑ Migration from v1.x

1. **Existing suggestions** will automatically work with the new button system
2. **Vote counts** are preserved during the transition
3. **Configuration** remains the same (some new options available)
