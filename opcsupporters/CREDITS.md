## Original Work by AAA3A

This cog is **heavily based on** and **inspired by** the original **ServerSupporters** cog created by **AAA3A**.

### Original Author Information
- **Developer**: AAA3A
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/AAA3A-AAA3A
- **Repository**: https://github.com/AAA3A-AAA3A/AAA3A-cogs
- **Original Cog**: ServerSupporters
- **License**: MIT License

### What We Borrowed from AAA3A's Original Work

#### Core Architecture & Logic (95% based on original)
- **Event Listeners**: `on_presence_update` and `on_member_update` structure
- **Caching System**: Anti-spam protection using `defaultdict(bool)` approach  
- **Change Detection**: Status tracking to only announce actual changes
- **Member Scanning**: Efficient pagination through large member lists
- **API Interaction**: Discord HTTP methods for clan tag detection
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception management throughout

#### Specific Code Patterns Adapted
- **Configuration System**: Guild-based config structure
- **Embed Design**: Color schemes, field layouts, and footer information
- **Regex Patterns**: Invite link detection in status messages
- **Permission Checks**: Admin/manage_guild permission requirements
- **Command Structure**: Hybrid command groups and subcommands

#### Original AAA3A Features We Maintained
```python
# These core concepts are directly from AAA3A's implementation:
- Smart member iteration with pagination
- Clan tag detection via Discord API
- Status activity parsing for custom activities  
- Cache-based spam prevention
- Change-only announcements
- Efficient bulk member scanning
- Robust error logging
```

### Our Modifications & Additions

#### What We Changed
- ‚ùå **Removed**: AAA3A_utils dependency (Settings, Menu, Cog classes)
- ‚ùå **Removed**: Role management functionality  
- ‚ùå **Removed**: Complex configuration options
- ‚úÖ **Added**: Hardcoded OPC-specific values
- ‚úÖ **Added**: Live statistics dashboard
- ‚úÖ **Added**: Announcement-only functionality
- ‚úÖ **Added**: Real-time supporter counts in embeds

#### Code We Wrote From Scratch
- Statistics counting and percentage calculations
- OPC-specific invite pattern matching
- Simplified configuration commands (`enabled`, `announcementchannel`)
- Custom embed layouts for announcements
- Supporter counting dashboard
