## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Database Schema:**
```sql
-- User profiles and progression
user_profiles (discord_id, summoner_name, region, total_points, level)

-- Achievement tracking  
user_achievements (discord_id, achievement_id, earned_at)

-- Server statistics and leaderboards
server_stats (guild_id, discord_id, stat_type, stat_value, updated_at)

-- Community challenges
challenges (guild_id, name, description, start_date, end_date, reward_points)
```

### **Rate Limiting Strategy:**
```python
# Smart request prioritization
Priority 1: Live game requests (immediate)
Priority 2: Profile updates (5 second delay)  
Priority 3: Match history (10 second delay)
Priority 4: Background tasks (60 second delay)

# Batch processing for efficiency
- Group similar requests together
- Cache frequently requested data
- Predictive loading for popular summoners
```

### **LCU Connection Process:**
```python
1. Scan running processes for LeagueClient.exe
2. Extract port and auth token from command line
3. Create SSL context bypassing self-signed certificates
4. Establish WebSocket connection for real-time events
5. Subscribe to relevant event channels
6. Maintain heartbeat and reconnection logic
```
