### Staff Actions
When a report is received, staff see an embed with action buttons:
- Click "Caution" to add warning points via the Cautions cog system
- Click "Mute 1h" for quick timeout
- Click "Ban" for immediate ban
- Click "Blacklist Reporter" if report is false/malicious
- Click "Dismiss" to mark as reviewed

**Caution Integration**: The Caution button requires the Cautions cog to be loaded. It will:
- Add configurable warning points to the user
- Automatically trigger threshold actions (mute, timeout, kick, ban)
- Use the same expiry and logging system as the Cautions cog
- Respect all Cautions cog configuration settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Reports not appearing?**
- Check if report channel is set: `[p]reportset status`
- Ensure bot has permission to send messages in report channel
- Verify the system is enabled: `[p]reportset toggle`

**Staff not getting pinged?**
- Add staff roles: `[p]reportset staffrole add @YourRole`
- Check role permissions and hierarchy
- Verify roles are mentionable

**Action buttons not working?**
- Ensure staff have "Moderate Members" permission
- Check bot has necessary permissions (timeout, ban, etc.)
- Verify user isn't higher in role hierarchy
- For Caution button: Ensure Cautions cog is loaded (`[p]load cautions`)

**Caution button shows error?**
- Load the Cautions cog: `[p]load cautions`
- Configure Cautions cog: `[p]cautionset` and `[p]setupmute`
- Check that warning thresholds are properly set up

**Context menu missing?**
- Commands may take time to sync globally
- Try using command method as alternative
- Restart bot if persistent

## Prerequisites

### Required Cogs
- **Cautions Cog** (optional but recommended): For the Caution button functionality
  - If not loaded, the Caution button will show an error message
  - Provides automatic threshold actions based on warning points
  - Handles warning expiry and comprehensive logging

### Bot Permissions
**Bot Permissions:**
- Send Messages (report channel)
- Embed Links (for report embeds)
- Moderate Members (for timeout action)
- Ban Members (for ban action)
- Manage Messages (for cleanup)
- Manage Roles (for Cautions cog mute integration)

**User Permissions:**
- None required for reporting
- Moderate Members required for action buttons
- Administrator required for configuration

## Integration with Cautions Cog

The Report cog seamlessly integrates with the Cautions cog to provide a comprehensive moderation workflow:

### Setup Integration
1. Install both cogs: `[p]cog install ultcogs report` and `[p]cog install ultcogs cautions`
2. Load both cogs: `[p]load report` and `[p]load cautions`
3. Configure Cautions: `[p]setupmute` and `[p]cautionset`
4. Configure Reports: `[p]reportset`

### How It Works
- **Caution Button**: When staff click "Caution" on a report, it opens a modal to add warning points
- **Automatic Thresholds**: Warning points are added to the user's total from the Cautions cog
- **Threshold Actions**: If the user reaches a configured threshold, automatic actions trigger (mute, timeout, kick, ban)
- **Unified Logging**: All actions are logged through the Cautions cog logging system
- **Expiry System**: Warnings added via reports follow the same expiry rules as the Cautions cog

### Benefits
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Handle reports and warnings in one interface
- **Consistent Enforcement**: All warnings use the same point system and thresholds
- **Automatic Escalation**: Problem users automatically face increasing consequences
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All actions are logged with case numbers and details

## Advanced Features
### Custom Cooldowns
```
[p]reportset cooldown 0      # No cooldown
[p]reportset cooldown 180    # 3 minutes
[p]reportset cooldown 600    # 10 minutes
```

### Multiple Staff Roles
Add multiple roles for comprehensive coverage:
```
[p]reportset staffrole add @Moderators
[p]reportset staffrole add @Admins
[p]reportset staffrole add @SeniorStaff
```

### Blacklist Management
Manage users who abuse the system:
```
[p]reportset blacklist add @Abuser      # Block from reporting
[p]reportset blacklist remove @Reformed # Unblock user
[p]reportset blacklist list             # View all blacklisted
```

## Data Storage

The cog stores:
- **Guild Settings**: Channel IDs, role IDs, configuration
- **User Data**: Last report time, total reports made, blacklist status
- **No Personal Data**: Only Discord IDs and report metadata
