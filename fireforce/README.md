## Game Mechanics

### Character System

Characters are created with random:
- Squadron assignment (1-8)
- Ability tier (Common to Secret)
- Starting abilities (1-3 based on tier)
- Base stats influenced by tier and squadron

### Ability Tiers

- **Common** (50% chance): Basic fire abilities
- **Uncommon** (30% chance): Improved fire control
- **Rare** (15% chance): Advanced pyrokinesis
- **Epic** (4% chance): Powerful flame techniques
- **Legendary** (1% chance): Extraordinary abilities
- **Secret** (0.1% chance): Unique powers like Adolla Burst

### Combat System

Battles are turn-based with reaction controls:
1. Player selects an ability by reacting with a number
2. Ability damage is calculated based on stats
3. Special ability effects are applied
4. Opponent (Infernal or player) takes their turn
5. Battle continues until one side is defeated

### Progression System

- Experience is awarded after winning battles
- Higher-level opponents grant more experience
- Experience needed for level-up increases with each level
- Stats improve automatically on level-up
- Defeating higher-level opponents grants bonus experience

### Server Events

- **Infernal Summon**: Creates a server-wide event where multiple players can battle the same powerful Infernal
- **Squadron Missions**: Cooperative events where all players work together for rewards

## Customization

Server admins can consider customizing aspects of the game by modifying the code:
- Adjust ability rarities and power levels
- Modify squadron bonuses
- Add custom boss encounters
- Create new types of missions
